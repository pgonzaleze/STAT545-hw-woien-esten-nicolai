## Process Report

I spent way to much time on this homework. I found it so entertaining to just see what types of data I could plot and how i could interpret these plots. The final report only includes a fraction of the plots I generated for the homework.

I find myself comfortable with using almost everything in ggplot2. I had a few challenges, for example how to arrange the contries by life expectancy in the bar plots in section 2.1.3, but I discovered a "quick fix", namely ```group = -lifeExp```. 

I started out traversing the internet for solutions to my problems. But the problems I had were very specific, so I realized that it was both more efficient and helpful to read the documentation and go to office hours. Shoutout to TAs and Vincenzo for being great intstuctors!
