#### An improper introduction to Esten

I'm a Norwegian visiting student, studying statistics for a year at UBC. I'm in a physics and mathematics program, but specialize in computational learning theory as it is a nice combination of

+ **Math**
    - Optimization
    - Convergence of methods
+ **Computer science**
    - Implementation
    - Method complexity
+ **Statistics**
    - Classification
    - Regression
    - Simulation

On non-school related interests, I love to hike, run, ski (cross-contry, alpine, telemark, randonee, anything), orienteering, and so fourth. I.e. all fun outdoor activities. I'm for sure engaged in VOC, and please don't hesitate to say hi if we were to be on the same VOC trip.
