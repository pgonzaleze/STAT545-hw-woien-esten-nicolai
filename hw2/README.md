## Process Report

This homework were really fun! However, I found myself spending way too much time just playing with the data and plotting functions. I find tidyverse to be a library with a very (!) high level of abstraction. This simplifies things a lot. For example, for the quantile based confidence interval (in section 2.2 in the [Gapminder Exploration](Gapminder_Exploration.md)), I found geom_ribbon at the [ggplot2 cheat sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf), used ?geom_ribbon to figure out how to use it, and wrote the code. Even though we haven't used geom_ribbon in class it felt really easy to use, and it worked immediately. Amazing.

But the high level of abstraction can also be problematic. When I tried to weight the data points when making a distribution plot (in section 2.2 in the [Gapminder Exploration](Gapminder_Exploration.md)), I really struggled with converting the population to a proportional population for a given year (i.e. "population" that sums to 1). Because I'm still in the experimentation phase, it didn't occur to me that I needed to group the data by year before I could sum the data for a given year. I finally figured it out, see the said section for my solution.
